My team and I built GoTDB over the course of three weeks. Before we began this project, none of us had any experience with web development. We worked for several hours each day, most of which were spent learning the tools. I eventually found my place in the back-end development; I worked with Django and created models to represent our content. I used MySQL to manage the database. Because we were on such a budget for time, there are a few details we had to overlook, including some front-end cosmetic issues. Overall, we're very happy with the result, especially considering we had no web development experience before this project.
