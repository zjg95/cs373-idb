People:

Eddard_Stark:
Played by Sean Bean
<p>Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, Eddard Stark is King Robert’s oldest and greatest friend. Raised together as wards of Lord Arryn, they were going to become brothers when his father Lord Rickard Stark agreed to wed Lyanna, Eddard’s sister, to the young Lord Robert. But Lyanna was stolen away by Prince Rhaegar, and Lord Rickard and his heir Brandon were murdered by the Mad King. Eddard became Lord of Winterfell, and with Robert and Lord Arryn led a rebellion that brought about the end of House Targaryen. A great commander and a dangerous warrior in his own right, Eddard Stark is perhaps best known for his sense of honor and duty; when Robert was willing to condone the murders of Prince Rhaegar’s infant children, Eddard was driven apart from him until the two were reunited in the grief following Lyanna’s lonely death.</p>
<p>Since the rebellion, Lord Eddard has largely kept to the North, only seeing the man he helped to the throne when he called his banners to join him in putting down Lord Greyjoy’s rebellion on the Iron Islands. Eddard is a great lord of the realm, and has the Stark look with his brown hair.</p>
<p>Eddard Stark has been aged 5 years for Game of Thrones. While he is certainly a skilled commander in the series, his skill as a swordsman are much more modest than they appear to be presented as in the show. His negative view of tourneys in the novels had more to do with not turning war into a game, as opposed to reports of the pilot presenting it as his preferring to keep possible opponents unaware of the full extent of his abilities.</p>



Tywin_Lannister:
Played by Charles Dance
<p>The Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, Lord Tywin is the wealthiest and among the most powerful magnates of the realm. Cold, calculating, and commanding, as a young man he was friend and Hand to King Aerys, and held the great ambition of seeing his daughter Cersei wed to Aerys’s heir. As Aerys descended into madness—marked both by paranoia and megalomania—their relationship grew strained, and finally broke beyond repair when Aerys took Tywin’s young heir, Ser Jaime, into the Kingsguard (thereby making him ineligible to inherit the Rock). Lord Tywin repaid this at the end of Robert’s Rebellion when he sacked King’s Landing and put Prince Rhaegar’s wife and children to the sword.</p>
<p>When Lord Tywin’s blonde hair began to grey, he shaved it, retaining only golden whiskers. Though nearer to 60 than 50, he is lean and fit as a man twenty years his junior. Tall and spare, his green eyes—a family trait—are hard. He almost never smiles, and he cannot stand laughter.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role is approximately 10 years older than the part as described in the novels.</p>



Robert_Baratheon:
Played by Mark Addy
<p>King Robert is King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Along with his closest friend Eddard Stark and their foster father Jon Arryn, Robert Baratheon led the rebellion that toppled the Targaryen dynasty after the Mad King, Aerys, began a reign of terror and his son, Prince Rhaegar, abducted his betrothed, Eddard’s sister Lyanna. Giving up his seat as Lord of Storm’s End—one of the great magnates of the realm—to his youngest brother Renly, he assumed the crown and named his brother Stannis as Lord of Dragonstone, the ancestral Targaryen seat, which has proven a bone of contention between them.</p>
<p>A mighty warrior in his youth, huge and powerfully built, in the last years Robert has gone to fat, eating and drinking too much.</p>
<p>Robert was convinced to marry Lord Tywin’s daughter, Cersei Lannister, making her queen. She has given him three children, but their relationship is a cold and unloving one. He remains a lusty man, however, and is a notorious whoremonger, with a dozen or more bastards to his discredit. He remains a boisterous lover of drink, generous to a fault, and entirely unsuited to ruling the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<p>According to reports, the character has been aged upwards from thirty-five to his forties. The actor cast in the role, Mark Addy, is notably shorter (8”+) than the character as described in the novels, who is said to be 6’6” tall, but it’s unclear whether cinematic methods will be used to make him seem taller.</p>



Daenerys_Targaryen:
Played by Emilia Clarke
<p>The last Targaryen princess, Daenerys is the daughter of the Mad King, Aerys II, who was born on Dragonstone after his death. Born during a storm, she was known as Daenerys Stormborn afterwards. Spirited away by loyal men with her brother, Viserys, in the years since the fall of House Targaryen they have fallen into a mean life, constantly moving for fear of the Usurper’s assassins while Viserys seeks some means to win back the Iron Throne. She is a very young woman, very beautiful in the inhuman way of the Valyrians, with silver-gold hair and purple eyes, and she has never known anything else than her brother’s domineering ways and obsession with the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Daenerys has been aged for the show. In the novels, she is 13 when she is first introduced. In Game of Thrones, she is 15 years old. Contacts to give her violet eyes were tried in the pilot, but proved more trouble than they were worth.</p>



Jon_Snow:
Played by Kit Harington
<p>Born of a mother Lord Eddard refuses to name—some believe him to have been gotten on the beautiful lady Ashara Dayne, who would later kill herself in grief at the brother Lord Eddard killed—Jon Snow has been raised at Winterfell since he was an infant, alongside Lord Eddard’s other children against the customs and traditions of the Seven Kingdoms. Unlike all the other children but Arya, Jon takes after his father in looks. Lean, dark-haired, and solemn, Jon is best friends with his half-brother Robb.</p>
<p>Jon Snow has been aged 3 years for the TV show, starting at 17 as opposed to 14. In the series, 16 is seen as he age of majority in the Seven Kingdoms, although this may not be true for the television show.</p>



Sansa_Stark:
Played by Sophie Turner
<p>The eldest of Lord Eddard’s two daughters, Sansa is everything a young maiden should be: sweet, gentle, pretty, able to dance and sing and embroider, and quite innocent. She loves stories of romance and chivalry, and would love nothing better than to marry a beautiful prince and give him beautiful children. Naturally, she does not get along with tomboyish younger sister, Arya, nor does she think much of her half-brother Jon because of his illegitimacy. In looks, she takes after Lady Catelyn with her auburn hair, but Catelyn says that Sansa’s beauty will surpass hers.</p>
<p>Sansa has been aged 2 years, to 13, in comparison to the novel.</p>



Arya_Stark:
Played by Maisie Williams
<p>The third of Lord Eddard’s legitimate children, Arya is the very picture of a tomboy, spending her time among the servants and their children, asking questions and playing games and avoiding all kind of of more lady-like pursuits. She exasperates her mother Lady Catelyn, who sometimes wishes she was more like her elder sister Sansa; it’s no surprise that the sisters do not get along. Closest with her bastard half-brother Jon, like him she’s the only other child of Eddard Stark who takes after him with her brown hair and grey eyes.</p>
<p>On the show, Arya started the show as being aged 11, whereas in the novels she starts at 9 years old.</p>



Stannis_Baratheon:
Played by Stephen Dillane
<p>The second of the three Baratheon brothers, Stannis is a bare year younger than King Robert, but the difference between them is night and day. Although both are tall, Stannis is lean, balding, and his beard is closely trimmed in contrast to the king’s. Moreover, his personality is vastly different: taciturn, strict, and remote. His views on justice are similarly harsh. During the rebellion, he held Storm’s End through a year of siege, and after King’s Landing fell he commaned the royal fleet that took Dragonstone. Robert made him master of ships on the small council, and then gave him the rule of Dragonstone—a sore point for Stannis, who expected to receive the much richer family seat of Storm’s End.</p>
<p>Dillane is shorter than Stannis in the novel, and we do not know if he will have the same hair and beard style. Like all three Baratheon actors, he also lacks the blue eyes. Finally, like Mark Addy, he’s much older than his character is in the novel (in fact, Dillane is quite a few years older than Addy)</p>



Tyrion_Lannister:
Played by Peter Dinklage
<p>The youngest son of the powerful Lord of Casterly Rock, Tyrion is known far and wide as the Imp. Bearing the shame of being a misshapen dwarf, Tyrion makes up with wit and intelligence what he lacks in good looks or strength. Though the Lannister family is believed to be a particularly well-knit clan, in fact Tyrion is hated by his father (who believes his dwarfism is a punishment from the gods for his sins, and who blames him for the death of his mother when she gave birth to him) and detested by his sister. Ser Jaime has always treated him well, however, and the two have a mutual love and respect for one another.</p>
<p>Tyrion’s legs are stunted and twisted, making walking for extensive periods painful, but his arms are surprisingly strong. His forehead bulges unflatteringly, and his eyes are mismatched, one the Lannister green and the other nearly black. His hair is a mixture of gold and platinum strands.</p>
<p>How far the actor will be made to look like the book description of Tyrion is an open question. In the novel, Tyrion is in his mid-20s, but he will likely be aged upwards for the series.</p>



Theon_Grejoy:
Played by DeObia Oparei
<p>Captain of the guard for Prince Doran Martell, Areo Hotah hails from the Free City of Norvos in the novels, and is known for his iron sense of duty and the great longaxe he carries and wields with great skill. Sold into slavery in Norvos, he was trained by the theocratic bearded priests to serve as a warrior and guard. In the novel, the end of his training was marked by burning a sigil of a double-bladed longaxe into his chest.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the character is intended to be Norvoshi in the show, given that Norvos is a former northern colony of Valyria and its inhabitants are Valyrian descendants for the most part; possibly Hotah, like the show’s Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, is intended to be seen as a non-native who became resident in Norvos.</p>



Joffrey_Baratheon:
Played by Jack Gleeson
<p>King Robert’s eldest son and heir, Prince Joffrey takes after his mother. Tall for his age, he’s lean and handsome, and very, very arrogant. He’s often accompanied by his sworn shield, the scarred Sandor Clegane.</p>
<p>As with a number of characters, Joffrey Baratheon has been aged up slightly from 12 at the start of the series to approximately 13, according to reports.</p>



Ramsay_Bolton:
Played by DeObia Oparei
<p>Captain of the guard for Prince Doran Martell, Areo Hotah hails from the Free City of Norvos in the novels, and is known for his iron sense of duty and the great longaxe he carries and wields with great skill. Sold into slavery in Norvos, he was trained by the theocratic bearded priests to serve as a warrior and guard. In the novel, the end of his training was marked by burning a sigil of a double-bladed longaxe into his chest.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the character is intended to be Norvoshi in the show, given that Norvos is a former northern colony of Valyria and its inhabitants are Valyrian descendants for the most part; possibly Hotah, like the show’s Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, is intended to be seen as a non-native who became resident in Norvos.</p>



Cersei_Lannister:
Played by Lena Headey
<p>Eldest daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock, Cersei is twin to Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Blonde, green-eyed, and one of the most beautiful women in the Seven Kingdoms, she has the Lannister pride and the ferocity of the mother lion when her children by King Robert are endangered. Her marriage to the king is loveless—a political marriage only, to secure her father’s allegiance after Robert won the Iron Throne—and their conflicts can be brutal. Her brother Jaime is often by her side, serving as her sworn shield as one of the knights of the Kingsguard. Her other brother Tyrion, however, is an affront to her sensibilities, and she denigrates the Imp mercilessly.</p>



Bran_Stark:
Played by Isaac Hempstead-Wright
<p>The fourth of Lord Eddard Stark’s children, Bran is a little boy whom his mother Lady Catelyn calls her “summer child” because he has never known any other season. He dreams of knighthood, enjoys exploring the castle of Winterfell and climbing upon its walls and roofs, and has a sweet and trusting nature which makes him a favorite of many in Winterfell. He takes after his mother, with her Tully auburn hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>On the show, the character is slightly older than in the novels and his hair does not seem very auburn (although apparently some reddish dye was worked into it to give him at least a bit of highlighting).</p>



Margaery_Tyrell:
Played by Natalie Dormer
<p>The youngest child of Lord Mace Tyrell, Margaery is a pretty young woman who is similar enough to her famed brother, Ser Loras, that some say they might as well be twins. She has the curling brown hair of the Tyrells, with brown eyes.</p>
<p>When introduced, Margaery is only fifteen years old, but the actress playing her part is nearly twice that age, and she is also rather older than Finn Jones, who plays Ser Loras. Will Margaery’s age be brought up to reflect this, perhaps making her an older sister? Also, photos of Ms. Dormer during production show her with blond hair, so it’s unclear whether she will retain Margaery’s hair color.</p>



Melisandre_of_Asshai:
Played by Carice van Houten
<p>A priestess of R’hllor from the fabled city of Asshai beside the Shadow, Melisandre is known as “the red woman”: she wears red robes and gowns, her hair is a deep burnished copper, even her eyes are red. Taller than many knights, her appearance is strikingly beautiful, slender, with a heart-shaped face, a full bosom, and a narrow waist. She converted Queen Selyse to the faith of R’hllor, and has gained great influence at Stannis’ court.</p>
<p>Carice van Houten is not so tall, but she’s certainly striking in her appearance. Given the trouble actors on the show have had with colored contacts, it’s unclear whether she will sport Melisandre’s red eyes.</p>



Daario_Naharis:
Played by Michiel Huisman
<p>A Tyroshi sellsword serving in the company called the Stormcrows, Daario is a flamboyant popinjay, all his garments spilling with lace and silk, his trident-forked beard and hair dyed blue to match his eyes. He has a golden tooth, and fights with an arakh and stilleto that feature bronze hilts that are shaped to look like naked and wanton women. He is arrogant beyond belief, and is given to impossible claims regarding his prowess at war and with women. </p>
<p>Daario is the novels is notable for wearing no or very little armor, trusting this speed and skill and good fortune to keep him alive, and so seems to eschew armor, unlike the character on the show. Daario, being a blue-eyed Tyroshi, is probably supposed to be of largely Valyrian descent, as Tyrosh was one of the Valyrian colonies. The current actor is the second to fill the role, following Ed Skrein who played the character in the third season.</p>



Jaime_Lannister:
Played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau
<p>Eldest son of Lord Tywin, the powerful Lord of Casterly Rock in the west of the Seven Kigndoms, Jaime would be heir if it were not for the fact that he is the most notorious of the Kingsguard, one of the seven knights sworn to protect the king and to give up marriage, lands, and titles. Though his bravery and his prowess is unquestioned—many would consider him the best knight in the Seven Kingdoms—he is infamous for having murdered the last king, the mad Aerys II, despite his vows as a Kingsguard.  The Starks and Lannisters are firmly opposed to one another, and much of this has to do with Jaime and his actions during the Sack of King’s Landing</p>
<p>He is Queen Cersei’s twin brother, and both share the golden-haired, green-eyed good looks of the Lannisters.</p>



Robb_Stark:
Played by Richard Madden
<p>The young heir to Winterfell, Robb’s best friend is his illegitimate half-brother Jon Snow, whom he’s known all his life; however, his father’s ward Theon Greyjoy is also a close friend, which is a difficulty, as Greyjoy doesn’t care for Jon. Like most of the rest of Catelyn’s children, he takes after her with his auburn hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Robb Stark has been aged 3 years, to 17, for the show. Though his robust, stockier build is contrasted with Jon Snow’s in the novels, it seems unlikely that there’ll be as notable a difference in the show.</p>



Jorah_Mormont:
Played by Iain Glen
<p>An exiled lord from the North, Ser Jorah earned his knighthood during Greyjoy’s Rebellion, being one of the first to enter the breach in the walls of Pyke during the last battle. Having won as a bride the daughter of a ancient and powerful Hightowers, he soon fell into great debt trying to keep her happy on his rustic, isolated island. Breaking the laws of Westeros by selling poachers into slavery, he fled Lord Stark’s justice, selling his sword in the east until his wife abandoned him. Balding, burly, and beared, Ser Jorah’s as tough as they come. His father Jeor is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.</p>
<p>As Martin has noted, Iain Glen is rather handsomer than how Ser Jorah is described. He does not seem to be balding, for that matter, which probably does not help.</p>



Petyr_Baelish:
Played by Aidan Gillen
<p>A short, slender man, Lord Petyr Baelish has had the byname of Littlefinger since he was a child, when he was fostered by Lord Tully in Riverrun and became acquainted with his son and daughters. At one time, Littlefinger developed a passion for Catelyn Tully, and even challenged her betrothed Brandon Stark for her hand in marriage. The duel ended badly, and Littlefinger nearly died. He was sent away from Riverrun in disgrace, and returned home to the Fingers in the Vale of Arryn, where his father was the smallest of small lords.</p>
<p>His cleverness and connection to Catelyn’s sister, Lysa Tully, helped lead him up from such low beginnings. He proved exceptionally capable at collecting taxes and helping to finance Lord Arryn’s desires, so much so that he was brought to King’s Landing to do the same. Within three years, he had become master of coin—the king’s treasurer—and joined the small council. He has held this office for some ten years.</p>
<p>Littlefinger is everyone’s friend, quick with a witticism. A courtier through and through, he’s always fashionable and never, ever caught out.</p>
<p>Aidan Gillen is certainly rather taller than Littlefinger is described to be,being 5’10” whereas Littlefinger was probably nearer 5’4” to 5’6”. The actor is also approximately 10 years older than the character, part of the general aging up of not only the children but the adult characters as well.</p>



Tommen_Baratheon:
Played by Callum Wharry
<p>The youngest of Queen Cersei’s three children, Tommen has her looks. A boy of only seven years, he has pretty golden girls and is somewhat pudgy, and his manner is sweet but rather shy.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role is somewhat older than described in the novels, and does not seem to be pudgy.</p>



Sandor_Clegane:
Played by Rory McCann
<p>A huge, powerful warrior, Sandor Clegane is known as the Hound, referring to the arms of his family. Estranged from his even more gigantic brother, Ser Gregor, the Hound is known throughout the realm by the horrible burn scar that covers half his face. It’s rumored that the source of the burn was a siege, or possibly dragon’s breath. After leaving his family lands in the west following his father’s death, he swore his sword to Queen Cersei and became sworn shield to her eldest son, Prince Joffrey. </p>
<p>Despite his prowess, the Hound is not a knight, in large part because of his refusal to accept knighthood. Known to be cruel, violent, and uncouth, Clegane thinks little of knights or their vows.</p>
<p>According to reports, the character has been aged upwards from about his late-twenties in the series to his mid-thirties.</p>



Jaqen_Hghar:
Played by Tom Wlaschiha
<p>Described as a young, handsome man, slim and with fine features, Jaqen H’ghar’s most notable trait is his long hair, red on one side and white on the other after one the fashions in the east. Hailing from th Free City of Lorath, he is first met as a chained and caged prisoner being taken by Yoren to the Wall. Rorge and Biter, his companions in the cage and in the black cells before it for unknown crimes, are brutal murderers but for some reason are afraid of him. He speaks the Common Tongue of Westeros, but with odd syntax, eschewing pronouns (e.g. “A man could use another taste of beer. A man has a thirst, wearing these heavy bracelets.”)</p>
<p>It seems the production attempted to stay quite faithful to the character. Wlaschiha has referred to having a red-and-white wig, though it may be that rather than being half and half, they’ve put streaks of white through it. He’s also noted that the way the character speaks in the novels has been carried over into the series. The only real difference we can find is the fact that he’s almost 40 years old, certainly older than Jaqen as described in the novels.</p>



Gendry:
Played by Joseph Dempsie
<p>A 14-year-old apprentice blacksmith, already large and muscular for his age, with shaggy black hair and blue eyes. A very stubborn youth who often is at odds with his fellow apprentices, he has been training with the master smith Tobho Mott for most of his life.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role is significantly older than the character as described, and is not so muscular as the character ought to be.</p>



Khal_Drogo:
Played by Jason Momoa
<p>The leaders of the mightiest khalasar on the Dothraki sea, Khal Drogo is a man entering his middle years. A great warrior and horseman, he is very tall with a long braid of hair that has never been cut because he has never lost a battle, and many bells hang from it to mark each of his many victories. Leading his tribe of horse-warriors, he has taken many slaves and looted many treasures, so much so that the magisters of Pentos pay him a bribe and provide him his great manse so that he will turn his attention elsewhere rather than attack them.</p>



Brienne_of_Tarth:
Played by Gwendoline Christie
<p>The only child of Lord Selwyn of Tarth, Brienne was never like other women—very tall and ungaily as a girl, and with a very plain appearance marked by a broad, coarse face with many freckles, crooked teeth, and more. Her father let her train at arms, due to her size (some 6’6” feet) and strength. When Lord Renly called his supporters to him at Highgarden, Lord Selwyn sends Brienne with the Tarth contingent. A skill warrior, her armor is enamelled blue, one of the colors of Tarth which is known as the Sapphire Isle for the blue of its waters. </p>
<p>The actress cast in the role is older than Brienne in the novel, and certainly much more beautiful to look at—it will be interesting to see what makeup does with her appearance. She is also certainly nothing like so broad and muscular as Brienne is described.</p>



Ygritte:
Played by Rose Leslie
<p>A wildling spearwife—a warrior woman—Ygritte is said to be “kissed by fire” by her fellow wildlings, thanks to her shaggy mop of red hair, which is considered lucky. About 20 years old, Ygritte is common in appearance, with a pug nose, crooked teeth, a round peasant’s face. </p>
<p>On the show, Ygritte is portrayed by Rose Leslie who, all in all, is rather prettier than the character as described in the novel.</p>



Roose_Bolton:
Played by Michael McElhatton
<p>One of the most powerful of the Northern lords, Roose Bolton is known for speaking very softly, but this does not mean he is gentle. He is cold-blooded and extremely pragmatic; as an example, he urged the immediate execution of the severely wounded Barristan Selmy following the Battle of the Trident, which suggestion Robert Baratheon overrode. Ruling the Dreadfort, he has no legitimate offspring but does have a bastard son that he has acknowledged and is raising, Ramsay Snow.</p>
<p>Another excellent casting choice, at least as far as physical appearance goes. His eyes do not seem as pale as Bolton’s extremely pale eyes, a detail often mentioned in the novels.</p>



Catelyn_Stark:
Played by Michelle Fairley
<p>The Lady of Winterfell, Catelyn Stark is the eldest child of Lord Tully of Riverrun, one of the great magnates of the realm. She married Lord Eddard at a time of war in lieu of his elder brother, who had been murdered by the Mad King. Mother to his five children, she holds to the Tully words of “Family, Duty, Honor”, and is a warm and loving mother and supportive wife. However, there is one thing that divides Catelyn from her husband: his illegitimate son, Jon Snow, who was fathered during the war and who has been raised at Winterfell among Eddard’s legitimate children against the customs of the Seven Kingdoms. Despite this, love and respect has grown between the two over the years.</p>
<p>Catelyn’s auburn hair and blue eyes is a common trait of the Tullys of Riverrun.</p>



Varys:
Played by Conleth Hill
<p>The king’s master of whisperers, Varys is a eunuch born in the Free City of Lys, across the Narrow Sea. He was brought to court by King Aerys, and it’s said that Aerys’s growing paranoia began when Varys began to ferret out every disloyalty against the Mad King. Despite this, Varys survived Aerys’s downfall and came to serve King Robert. He is known derisively as the Spider, even if he sits on the king’s small council and holds the style of Lord Varys.</p>
<p>Plump, perfumed, powdered, hairless as an egg, and wearing garments such as they wear in Lys, Varys cuts an exotic figure in the court of the Red Keep. He has soft, moist hands, and often titters as he speaks obliquely and sometimes mincingly about his “little birds” and the whispers they bring them.</p>



Bronn:
Played by Jerome Flynn
<p>A sellsword in his early to mid thirties, Bronn is described as bone thin and bone hard, with black eyes, black hair, and a stubble of beard. Bronn is as mercenary as they come, caring only for his profits.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role, Jerome Flynn, was born in 1963, making him approximately 10-15 years older than the character described in the series. His appearance is also not quite the same, but it is a minor detail.</p>



Viserys_Targaryen:
Played by Harry Lloyd
<p>The only surviving son of the Mad King Aerys, as a little boy Viserys and his pregnant mother were spirited away from King’s Landing before the fall of the Targaryen dynasty. His mother died giving birth to his sister, Daenerys. Since then, Viserys and his sister have lived in exile, and Viserys has become known as the Beggar King because of their poverty as they move from Free City to Free City, trying to find someone who will aid him in retaking the Iron Throne. A thin young man, Viserys has the unnatural looks of the Targaryens, but he has lived too long in dread and privation; he has a notorious temper, and often abuses his sister.</p>



Shae:
Played by Sibel Kekilli
<p>A slim, dark-haired young woman of nineteen years, Shae is a prostitute and camp follower. Her face is very expressive, her smiles alternately shy, innocent, and wicked.</p>
<p>The actress playing the role is approximately 10 years older than the character, and her features are not typically European (as with all the other Westerosi actors).</p>



Talisa_Stark:
Played by DeObia Oparei
<p>Captain of the guard for Prince Doran Martell, Areo Hotah hails from the Free City of Norvos in the novels, and is known for his iron sense of duty and the great longaxe he carries and wields with great skill. Sold into slavery in Norvos, he was trained by the theocratic bearded priests to serve as a warrior and guard. In the novel, the end of his training was marked by burning a sigil of a double-bladed longaxe into his chest.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the character is intended to be Norvoshi in the show, given that Norvos is a former northern colony of Valyria and its inhabitants are Valyrian descendants for the most part; possibly Hotah, like the show’s Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, is intended to be seen as a non-native who became resident in Norvos.</p>



Ellaria_Sand:
Played by Indira Varma
<p>Bastard daughter of the Dornish Lord Uller, Ellaria Sand is the paramour of Prince Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper, and the mother of some (but not all) of his illegitimate daughters. She is no great beauty, but striking in appearance.</p>



Jeor_Mormont:
Played by James Cosmo
<p>Called the Old Bear, Lord Mormont was once Lord of Bear Island in the North until he chose to take the black, leaving his seat and lands to his son, Jorah Mormont. A grizzled old man with a large, bald head and shaggy grey beard, the Old Bear is now Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. He commands it from Castle Black, the chief of the three castles the Watch still maintains along the length of the Wall. He is often accompanied by a pet raven. He has in his possession the Mormont ancestral weapon, the Valyrian steel bastard sword Longclaw, although his son’s disgrace has led him to keep it locked away in a chest.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role is neither bald nor so bearded, but otherwise seems to match very well.</p>



Samwell_Tarly:
Played by John Bradley
<p>The fattest boy Jon Snow has ever seen, Samwell Tarly stood as heir to the proud Lord of Horn Hill. However, Samwell proved so embarassing—for his weight,  his inability to withstand the sight of blood, his fear of pain and apparent cowardice, his love of books and dancing—that Lord Randyll forces him to renounce his inheritance and take the black of the Night’s Watch. Samwell calls himself a craven, but despite this he finds friends among his fellow recruits. He is well-read and intelligent, but very shy and low in self-esteem.</p>
<p>The actor cast in the role does not seem overweight as Samwell is described, and is 4-6 years older than the character.</p>



Davos_Seaworth:
Played by Liam Cunningham
<p>Once a common, but notorious, smuggler, Davos chose to smuggle in supplies to the besieged Storm’s End during Robert’s rebellion. The food he provided allowed the garrison to hold out against the besieging force under Lord Tyrell. Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos by raising him to knighthood, at which point he took the name Seaworth and the sigil of a black ship with an onion on its sail in memory of the deed… but Stannis also required punishment for Davos’s smuggling past, ordering that the first joint of each finger of his left hand be removed. Davos asked Stannis to do it himself, which he did. Since then, Davos has served Lord Stannis as he became Lord of Dragonstone. He holds lands in Cape Wrath, where he keeps his wife, and has seven sons, the next youngest of which—Devan—serves as Stannis’s squire.</p>
<p>Obviously, the actor cast in the role is not lacking in finger joints. A special glove and occasionally CGI to convey this. As Liam Cunningham is left-handed, it’s his right hand that will seem to be missing joints, as opposed to Davos’s left.</p>



Gilly:
Played by Hannah Murray
<p>One of the wives of Craster, Gilly is (like most of his other nineteen wives) also his daughter. Pregnant when she is first met at Craster’s Keep, she is a skinny girl with large eyes, dark hair, and a frightened manner. She is quite young. The actress in the role is older than the character from the novel, but otherwise seems a good fit.</p>



Tormund:
Played by Kristofer Hivju
<p>Old and short, but very broad and strong, Tormund Giantsbane is a famed warrior among the wildlings, and certainly in his own mind: he has a dozen bynames (at least some which he doubtless gave to himself) and is given to boastful tall tales. He is quick to laugh, quick to rage, and quick to make friends.</p>
<p>The actor is significantly younger that Giantsbane is in the novels—Tormund has several grown children—and certainly not so very broad.</p>



Missandei:
<p>A child slave captured from the isle of Naath, she is dark of skin and golden-eyed, and is very skilled in languages. She acts as scribe and translator to Kraznys, a slaver of Astapor. Her brothers were also taken as slaves, and are among the Unsullied.</p>
<p>Nathalie Emmanuel is much older than the character in the novel, and obviously lacks the golden eyes.</p>
